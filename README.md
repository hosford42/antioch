sandboxed code execution allows users to author content in a secure and robust environment.

Feature Set
-----------

* Django-powered, standards-compliant web interface using HTML5, CSS3, jQuery, REST and COMET

* Sandboxed Pure-Python execution enables live programming of in-game code

* PostgreSQL-backed object store scales to million of objects and provides transactional security during verb execution

* Flexible plugin system, highly scalable messaging using RabbitMQ
